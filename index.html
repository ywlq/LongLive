                        30s–40s: They share a quiet, reverent gaze, hands touching beneath the chuppah.
                        40s–50s: David gently leads Michal around the chuppah; a small child runs in with a bouquet.
                        50s–60s: The child offers the bouquet with a shy smile, then steps back to watch.</div>

She leans forward slightly in her rocking chair, reaching out to pluck a fallen leaf from the porch floor, its veins glowing silver in the moonlight. The moon casts a soft glow over the tranquil landscape, highlighting the distant hills and the twinkling stars above. The rustle of leaves and a distant owl hoot blend with the gentle creak of the rocking chair. medium‑close static</div>
